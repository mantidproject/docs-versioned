<section id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The SCD Event Data Reduction interface(MantidEV) is a wrapper around
Mantid algorithms that is intended to help handle the basic data reduction
steps for one crystal orientation in a time-of-flight single crystal neutron
diffraction experiment.  The basic steps of loading data, converting to
reciprocal space, finding peaks, finding a  <a class="reference internal" href="../../concepts/Lattice.html#lattice"><span class="std std-ref">UB matrix</span></a>
(indexing), choosing and modifying a conventional cell and peak integration
are supported.</p>
<p>All of the steps carried out can also be done by using the algorithms
directly from from the MantidWorkbench GUI.  In most cases, many more
control parameters and options are available when the algorithm is
used directly from the GUI or a Python script. MantidEV attempts to provide good
default values for many of the additional parameters to make the
process more user-friendly.  Since the workspaces created and/or used
by MantidEV are stored in Mantid, it is easy to intersperse using
the full algorithms from Mantid with applying various steps from
MantidEV, if the additional options are needed.</p>
<p>After going through these initial steps for one or two runs from a
sequence of runs at different crystal orientations, there should be
enough information to set up a configuration file and use a parallel
reduction script to reduce and combine all of the runs in the
experiment to produce a combined file of integrated intensities from
all of the runs.  Alternatively, each run can be processed
individually in MantidEV and the resulting integrated intensities can
be saved/appended to a combined file.  In either case, the combined
file of integrated intensities will need to be further processed by
ANVRED to apply the Lorentz correction and adjust for the incident
spectrum, detector sensitivity differences and absorption.  Finally
GSAS and/or SHELLX can be applied to the resulting HKL file.</p>
</section>
<section id="major-steps">
<h2>Major Steps<a class="headerlink" href="#major-steps" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<section id="select-data">
<h3>Select Data<a class="headerlink" href="#select-data" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>In most cases this tab will be used to select a NeXus event file to
load, using the Browse button.  Names are also needed for several
Mantid workspaces that will be used.  The event workspace holds the
time-of-flight event data loaded from the NeXus file, the
multi-dimensional(MD) workspace holds the events mapped to reciprocal
space and the peaks workspace listed on the Find Peaks tab holds a
list of peaks.  If the Browse button is used to select a NeXus file to
be loaded, default names will be set for all of these workspaces.
Alternatively, if the user has already loaded data and converted to an
MD workspace in MantidWorkbench, then those workspaces can be specified in
MantidEV and the work does not need to be repeated.</p>
<p>To actually load a selected file, press the apply button at the bottom
of the tab.  This will take a little while depending on the file size,
but you can watch the progress bar on the the GUI and note what
workspaces have been created, to see how it is progressing.</p>
</section>
<section id="find-peaks">
<h3>Find Peaks<a class="headerlink" href="#find-peaks" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When the event and MD workspaces have been constructed, move to the
Find Peaks tab and choose a name for the peaks workspace to create.
Also, provide a rough estimate of the maximum real space cell edge,
which is used to avoid finding the same peak several times on
different parts of the same peak.  The min peak intensity may have to
be lowered below 100 for a sample that does not give strong peaks.
With very strong peaks and low background, the min peak intensity can
be raised to 10,000 or higher.  You also need to guess how many peaks
should be found.  With a reasonably good small molecule crystal, it
should work to start by finding 50 peaks.  After finding the peaks,
try to index them on the next tab, as described in the next
paragraph. If most all of them index you can come back to the Find
Peaks tab and increase the number.  Repeat the process until roughly
10% to 20% of the found peaks no longer index.  At that point you have
probably found most of the actual peaks that can be found.</p>
</section>
<section id="find-ub">
<h3>Find UB<a class="headerlink" href="#find-ub" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>On the Find UB tab, use the Find UB Using FFT option to find an
initial UB for the peaks.  NOTE: The estimated lower bound and
estimated upper bound on the cell edges are bounds on the Niggli
reduced cell.  They need to be in the right ball park.  In particular
if you use 3 for the min and 15 for the max, most small molecules will
index fine, but of course a protein will not.  If a,b or c are outside
of the interval [min,max] the algorithm will fail.  Alternatively, if
you previously found and saved a UB, you can load it and use it to
index the peaks, or if you loaded a peaks file with indexed peaks, you
can find the UB using the indexed peaks.</p>
</section>
<section id="choose-cell">
<h3>Choose Cell<a class="headerlink" href="#choose-cell" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>If everything worked to this point, go to the Choose Cell tab and
press Apply to show the possible conventional cells corresponding to
the current Niggli reduced cell.  You should see the cell you expect
displayed in the results log window.  If so, you can
either actually select the cell (and re-index the peaks) at this time,
or proceed to integrate the peaks first and then come back to this tab
and select the cell and re-index the peaks.  The desired cell can be
selected by specifying the type and centering, if there was only one
option shown with the desired type and centering.  In the unusual case
where a less-well fitting cell of a specific type is desired, the form
number in the list of possible cells can be noted and used to select
the particular cell with that form number.</p>
<p>NOTE: The process of choosing a conventional cell assumes that the
current cell is a Niggli reduced cell, as produced by the
<a class="reference internal" href="../../algorithms/FindUBUsingFFT-v1.html#algm-findubusingfft"><span class="std std-ref">FindUBUsingFFT</span></a> algorithm.  If a
conventional cell (that is not a Niggli reduced cell) has already been
chosen, then the list of possible cells will be non-sense.  In
particular, this tab should NOT be used twice in succession in most
cases.  Similarly, if the <a class="reference internal" href="../../concepts/Lattice.html#lattice"><span class="std std-ref">UB matrix</span></a> was obtained by
loading an IsawUB, or by computing the UB based on a list of previously
indexed peaks, the UB might not correspond to a Niggli reduced cell, and
the Choose Cell tab should be skipped.</p>
</section>
<section id="change-hkl">
<h3>Change HKL<a class="headerlink" href="#change-hkl" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>If some rearrangement of the chosen cell is needed, an arbitrary
linear transformation can be applied to the HKL values using the
Change HKL tab.  The transformation specified is applied to the Miller
indexes of each peak and a corresponding transform is applied to the
<a class="reference internal" href="../../concepts/Lattice.html#lattice"><span class="std std-ref">UB matrix</span></a>, if the Apply button is pressed.</p>
</section>
<section id="integrate">
<h3>Integrate<a class="headerlink" href="#integrate" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are currently three options for doing the peak integration.  The
spherical integration seems to be the best option in most cases, since
it is fast and has given values as good as the other options in the
cases we have tested.  Spherical integration uses spherical regions of
a specified size in reciprocal space.</p>
<p>Alternatively, 2-D Fitting Integration is done using histogrammed data
in detector space.  A 2-D Gaussian with background is fitted to the
counts on each time-of-flight slice in a peak region.  The resulting
background estimate together with the actual counts on that slice are
used to obtain the net integrated counts on that slice.  The net
integrated counts on the set of slices through the peak can be
optionally fitted with an Ikeda-Carpenter function, or just summed to
obtain the total net intensity for the whole peak.  Due to the cost of
the fitting calculations, this integration method takes substantially
more time than the other two options.</p>
<p>The third option, Ellipsoidal Integration, is another reciprocal space
integration similar to the spherical integration, except that it uses
ellipsoidal regions determined from the principal axes of the cloud of
events near a peak.  This is slightly slower than the spherical
integration method.</p>

<section id="usage-example">
<h2>Usage Example<a class="headerlink" href="#usage-example" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>To start by loading data, choose the Select Data tab and use the
Browse button to navigate to the event NeXus file you wish to load.
When you select the file with the file browser, default names for the
event workspace and the MD workspace will be generated and filled out
at the top of this tab.  A default name for the peaks workspace will
also be filled out on the Find Peaks tab. If you later edit the file
name, say to change the run number in the file name to the next number
in a sequence of runs, you will need to press &lt;Enter&gt; on the keyboard
to also update the default name for the event, MD and peaks
workspaces.  An ISAW-style detector calibration file (.DetCal) can be
specified.  If used, the information in the .DetCal file will update
the information about the instrument’s detectors as the data is
loaded.  The second calibration file, Filename2, is currently only
used for the second panel of detectors on the SNAP instrument at the
SNS.</p>
<p>Check that the maximum |Q| to load is appropriate for the current
sample and instrument settings.  The max |Q| sets a limit on the
sample-frame x,y and z components of the data that is loaded. The
Apply Lorentz Correction option should also be set at this stage for
small molecules.  Applying the Lorentz correction helps find the peaks
at higher Q.  When the input fields have been filled out correctly as
shown below, press the Apply button to actually load the data and
convert it to an MD workspace.  This will take some time, depending on
the size of the data.  The progress bar will show the
progress of the underlying algorithms.  The work is done when the MD
workspace has been created and appears in the list of
Workspaces.</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/MantidEV_Select_Data.png" src="../../_images/MantidEV_Select_Data.png" />
</figure>
<p>When the data has been successfully loaded, proceed to the Find Peaks
tab.  When initially reducing a run, peaks will need to actually be
found by searching through the MD workspace.  To facilitate the search
the user must provide an estimate of the maximum value for the real
space reduced cell edge lengths, a, b, c, the number of peaks that
should be found and the minimum relative intensity of an MD histogram
box that is required for a box to be checked as a possible peak.
These values do not have to be specified exactly, but reasonable
values should be chosen to avoid excessive calculation and to avoid
finding many false peaks that are really just noise.  The values shown
below are reasonable for this sapphire sample.  The estimated max of
a, b, c is used to avoid finding several locations on the same strong
peak as separate peaks.  The Min Intensity(above ave) parameter will
avoid considering very low intensity boxes as possible peaks and will
allow the algorithm to stop searching even if the requested number of
peaks exceeds the number of actual peaks in the data This computation
is quite fast, so if the quality of the sample is unknown, it is
useful to start requesting a smaller number of peaks, say 25-50, and
gradually increase the number requested until too many peaks are being
found that don’t index properly on the next tab.  Press the Apply
button to actually carry out the calculation and find peaks.  As
before the progress can be seen on the progress bar and the
step is complete when the specified peaks workspace has been created.</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/MantidEV_Find_Peaks.png" src="../../_images/MantidEV_Find_Peaks.png" />
</figure>
<p>The next step is to find a <a class="reference internal" href="../../concepts/Lattice.html#lattice"><span class="std std-ref">UB matrix</span></a> that will index
the peaks. MantidEV uses the FindUBUsingFFT algorithm for this purpose.
This algorithm requires and estimate of the range of lengths of the edges
of the reduced cell for the sample.  As before, these don’t need to be
specified exactly, but should be reasonable and should usually cover a
slightly larger range of values than absolutely required.  Since the
reduced cell parameters for sapphire are roughly 4.75, 4.75 and 5.13,
choosing a min of 3 or 4 and a max of 7 or somewhat larger is
reasonable.  A tolerance on the allowable indexing error in h,k,l also
must be specified.  A tolerance in the range of 0.1 to 0.15 is usually
a good choice.  After finding the <a class="reference internal" href="../../concepts/Lattice.html#lattice"><span class="std std-ref">UB matrix</span></a>, it can be
immediately used to index the peaks, if the Index Peaks Using UB option is
selected.  The computed h,k,l values can either be rounded to the
nearest integers or left as fractional values to see how well the
<a class="reference internal" href="../../concepts/Lattice.html#lattice"><span class="std std-ref">UB matrix</span></a> indexes the peaks.  When the parameters have
been filled out, as shown below, press Apply to do the calculation.</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/MantidEV_Find_UB.png" src="../../_images/MantidEV_Find_UB.png" />
</figure>
<p>After pressing Apply, it is helpful to look at the output from
<a class="reference internal" href="../../algorithms/FindUBUsingFFT-v1.html#algm-findubusingfft"><span class="std std-ref">FindUBUsingFFT</span></a> in the Results Log window,
shown below.  In particular, note what the lattice
parameters are and how many peaks are indexed.  The lattice parameters
should be the lattice parameters of the Niggli reduced cell for the
sample and the majority of the peaks should have been indexed.  In
this example the cell parameters 4.752, 4.763, 5.133, 62.312, 62.323,
69.979 are reasonably close to the Nigli reduced cell parameter for
sapphire, and 244 of 250 peaks were indexed, which is quite good. If
virtually all of the peaks are correctly indexed, it will probably be
possible to find more valid peaks by going back to the Find Peaks tab
and increasing the Number of Peaks to Find and/or decreasing the Min
Intensity.  The process of finding peaks and then checking how many of
them are correctly indexed can be repeated, gradually increasing the
number of valid peaks.</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/MantidEV_Find_UB_result.png" src="../../_images/MantidEV_Find_UB_result.png" />
</figure>
<p>In many cases the Niggli reduced cell from the FFT algorithm will not
be the desired conventional cell.  The next tab, Choose Cell, allows
the user to switch both the h,k,l values and the UB to a selected
conventional cell.  To do this first select Show Possible Cells as
shown below and press Apply.</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/MantidEV_Choose_Cell.png" src="../../_images/MantidEV_Choose_Cell.png" />
</figure>
<p>A list of conventional cells together with the error in the match to
the current Niggli reduced cell will be listed in the Results Log window, as shown below.
In this case we see that form #9,
a Rhobohedral R cell with lattice parameters 4.7523, 4.7560, 12.9976,
90.011, 89.920, 119.882 and cell volume 254.71 is the first option in
the list.  This is a good match for sapphire and we would select that
cell.  If the expected conventional cell is not present in the list,
you can increase the Max Scalar Error parameter to see more possible
cells, though the new cells will not match as well as the ones in the
original list.  If you make the Max Scalar Error parameter huge, you
will see a list of all possible cells together with the error in
matching, whether or not they match the current cell at all.  If the
conventional cell you want to use is the best match for a cell of the
required type and centering, you can check Select Cell of Type and
choose the cell type and centering.  In the rare case that the desired
cell is not the best fitting cell of a particular type and centering,
that cell can be selected based on the form number shown in the list
of possible cells.</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/MantidEV_Choose_Cell_result.png" src="../../_images/MantidEV_Choose_Cell_result.png" />
</figure>
<p>To integrate the current set of peaks, select the Integrate tab.  The
simplest and often most effective integration method integrates using
spheres in reciprocal space.  To use this, specify the radius of a
region to be considered the peak, as well as inner and outer radii for
regions to be considered background around that peak as shown below.
Pressing Apply will actually carry out the integration in a few
seconds.</p>
<figure class="align-default">
<img alt="../../_images/MantidEV_Integrate.png" src="../../_images/MantidEV_Integrate.png" />
</figure>
<p>After carrying out the integration, the integrated intensities can be
observed in the peaks workspace in the GUI.  The list of indexed
and integrated peaks can also be saved in an ISAW format peaks file,
by choosing Save Isaw Peaks from the File item on the MantidEV menu
bar.  This will save the peaks in a simple ASCII file as shown below.
The peaks file begins with a table of information about the instrument
and the detctors.  Following that information is a list of the peaks
from each detector module.  The h,k,l of each peak is listed, together
with the row, column and time channel where the peak occurred.  The
integrated intensity and estimated standard deviation for the
intensity are listed as INTI and SIGI.</p>
