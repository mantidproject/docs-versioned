Description
-----------
The LoadNGEM algorithm will read .edb files generated by the nGEM
detector.

The detector produces files that are up to 1GB in size, so if the
collection produces more than 1GB of data, it will create a new file
to write the rest of the data to. When all of the files are selected
they are loaded into a single workspace containing all of the events.

The loading process allows the option to include a count of the number
of events in each frame (begun by a T0 event), which is loaded as a
plottable workspace. This can then be used to determine what is considered
a "good frame" so that only good frames are included in the final data.
